Here's a peek at the current setup...

You'll notice a pattern of trying to find and support more sustainable and ethical tech products and business practises (ie, shun Big Tech). It's a fun challenge too. I've [written more about that over here]().

See what other smart people* are using over at [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/)!

### Hardware

<ul class="u-pad-is-0">
  <UsesItem type="laptop" title="Framework 13" url="https://frame.work/gb" icon={siFramework}>I'm in love. It's modular, repairable and putting it together made me feel 16 again fiddling around with desktop PCs. Proof you can make tech to last.</UsesItem>
  <UsesItem type="phone" title="Fairphone 15" url="https://fairphone.co.uk">Also modular, repairable and has the most ethically sourced supply chain around. They recently released the 16 and actively said *don't* upgrade if your current phone is still working. Mine works great. Pairs nicely with a Framework.</UsesItem>
</ul>
### Productivity
<ul class="u-pad-is-0">
  <UsesItem type="email" title="Proton Mail" url="https://proton.me/mail" icon={siProtonmail}>Privacy by default, Swiss provider, nonprofit majority shareholder (check, check, check). Still gives me all the features I need. Encryption makes it harder to integrate with other tools but a workable trade-off. Happy to pay for such good services and avoid exploitative ad-based business models. Strong recommend.</UsesItem>
  <UsesItem type="meetings" title="Whereby" url="https://whereby.com">A nice EU-based, end-to-end encrypted Meet alternative that does all the things and looks pretty. I have my eye on trying out <a href='https://www.meet.coop/'>meet.coop</a> in the future.</UsesItem>
  <UsesItem type="search engine" title="Duck Duck Go" url="https://duckduckgo.com/" icon={siDuckduckgo}>What even is a search engine anymore? This one's a good alternative to Google though and serves me well. I appreciate not *having* to see AI generated summaries when most of the time I don't need them; just wasted energy.</UsesItem>
</ul>
### This site
<ul class="u-pad-is-0">
  <UsesItem type="framework" title="Astro" url="https://astro.build/" icon={siAstro}>I'm loving Astro. Nice developer experience, flexible, super fast, suits most of my needs. It's refreshingly lightweight compared to heavier frameworks. Big fan.</UsesItem>
  <UsesItem type="hosting" title="Netlify" url="https://www.netlify.com/" icon={siNetlify}>Unicorn for a reason, very slick and all. I'd like to find a renewable energy alternative but there doesn't seem to be anything too practical out there yet. It's my go to for clients so it's helpful to use it myself.</UsesItem>
  <UsesItem type="analytics" title="Simple Analytics" url="https://simpleanalytics.com" icon={siSimpleanalytics}> You guessed it, a privacy first, EU-based Google alternative. Nothing tracked, no cookie banners needed. Also GA4 UI sucks. My site stats are <a href="https://analytics.simseneca.design/">public for your pleasure</a>.</UsesItem>
