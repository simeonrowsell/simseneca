intro: |  
  TravelLocal connects travellers with local travel experts right there in their destination. If you want to go to Egypt, who better to plan your tailor-made trip for you than someone actually living and working in Cairo?  

  This is a persuasive proposition, but not enough customers were understanding it.

  I led product design on a key project to optimise the landing experience by efficiently communicating TravelLocal's USP, accelerating the ah-ha moment and setting customers up for positive engagement.
