intro: |  
  TravelLocal connects travellers with local travel experts right there in their destination. If you want to go to Egypt, who better to plan your tailor-made trip for you than someone actually living and working in Cairo?

  This is a persuasive proposition, but not enough customers were understanding it.

  I led product design on a key project to optimise the landing experience by efficiently communicating TravelLocal's USP and accelerating the "ah-ha" moment, leading to a hugely impactful 200%+ increase in customer engagement.

## Understanding the business challenge and defining a North Star

The core proposition of TravelLocal is that they connect you with local travel experts in the destination. So if you want to travel to Egypt, for example, you‚Äôd send your trip preferences (a _request_) and TravelLocal would connect you with a tour operator actually in Cairo to plan your trip.

<mark>Central to this model is the conversation between local experts and customers</mark>, and for the customer to continue to move through the planning journey towards booking, those conversations need to be super positive and engaging from the start.

As the company looked to scale, myself and the product team understood the key business challenge was to <mark>ensure that the customers we were onboarding were ready and enthusiastic about the key part of the proposition</mark>; the conversation. If not, local experts would get in touch with customers but receive no reply, leading to unsustainable, wasted effort and frustration.

One way we quantitatively measured the quality of this early conversation was whether customers sent three messages to their local expert, which we identified as a significant tipping point reflecting meaningful engagement.

üåü <mark>We set our North Star metric as improving this customer engagement.</mark>

Ultimately the more customers reach this early milestone, the more continue down the funnel and eventually convert into bookings.

So important to the company's growth was this North Star that it led us across multiple pieces of work, including [successfully improving the initial onboarding experience](./onboarding-and-expectation-setting).

We set ourselves a couple of early guardrails‚Ä¶

1. We were prepared for the potential reduction of overall trip requests so long as that was counterbalanced by higher engagement. Better proposition comprehension might lead to more visitors instead deciding it wasn't for them and bouncing; not neccessarily a bad result. <mark>However to mitigate risk, we set the amount of requests we‚Äôd be comfortable seeing a reduction by.</mark>
2. We wanted to learn as quickly as possible, so we decided to hyper-focus on <mark>rapid iteration and shipping lightweight MVP‚Äôs</mark>; embracing a ‚Äògood enough‚Äô mentality.

## Targeting the customer landing experience

As a tech company in the travel space, a key pillar of the on-site browsing experience were country pages; one for each destination TravelLocal offered. At the time, PPC was the focus of TravelLocal‚Äôs acquisition strategy, landing visitors on these country pages.

We could therefore be confident that for most visitors they‚Äôd already decided the destination they wanted to travel to, so working on any earlier destination browsing experience wasn‚Äôt going to be of high impact.

Having previously made [successful improvements to the customer experience lower in the funnel](./onboarding-and-expectation-setting), <mark>we decided this time to improve the landing experience right at the top</mark>. The strategy was that we‚Äôd see a trickle down effect. If we nailed customer enthusiasm and proposition comprehension early, this would positively affect the rest of the customer experience.

_Diagram of the funnel, pointing to the top as our next place to focus on_

<mark>As a newer challenger in the travel space, TravelLocal‚Äôs country page was often customers‚Äô first impression of the brand. Getting this right was critical for customer success and I was confident that improving it could drive high impact.</mark>

## Discovering why customers don‚Äôt engage

## Growing confidence in the 'ah-ha' moment

I‚Äôd long considered the moment that customers understand the role of the local expert to be the 'ah-ha' moment and this round of research only bolstered my confidence in this.

_Gleanly quotes about the ah-ha moment_

<mark>Identifying the 'ah-ha' moment sharpened our focus on optimising for that key emotional inflection point.</mark>

## Critiquing the current experience

## Bringing customer learnings together to set design directions

From speaking with customers and working with analytics data over my time at TravelLocal there were <mark>a few related factors I knew also influenced a customer's perception of the landing experience</mark>.

- Many customers were new to TravelLocal, with little or no prior brand exposure.
- Customers weren‚Äôt only visiting TravelLocal when looking for a holiday, they were also browsing competitor sites.
- Customers were looking for bespoke, tailor-made travel, not off-the-shelf packages.
- The majority of visitors were coming to the site on mobile.

By now we‚Äôd built up a really good picture of the customer and their needs at this early stage. <mark>Bringing all this knowledge together gave me three key design directions to take into prototyping.</mark> 

Designs needed to...

1. ...lead with differentiating brand proposition before delivering country content.
2. ...clearly communicate the tailor-made nature of the trips.
3. ...focus on mobile first.

## Leading with the proposition

TravelLocal's proposition is strong, but was weakly communicated.

As well as customers receiving a more authentic travel experience, TravelLocal‚Äôs model also returns autonomy to those local tour operators who are often lost in a sea of middlemen in traditional models. With TravelLocal those local experts are front and centre, giving them more control over how tourism affects their community as well as ensuring more of customers' money goes straight into the local economy.

<mark>This approach to tailor-made travel challenges the established model, introducing a new concept that requires a shift in travellers' mental models.</mark>

As we‚Äôve seen, the current landing experience was geared more towards country content than anything unique to TravelLocal itself. <mark>The proposition was missing, and with it any distinguishing selling points.</mark>

We knew we needed to flip this on its head; <mark>customers needed to understand _why_ TravelLocal and _how_ it worked.</mark>

### Evolving and deepening the brand proposition pillars

I‚Äôd previously created a ‚ÄúHow it works‚Äù page on the site which was the company‚Äôs first run at defining and communicating the pillars of the brand proposition. Bringing these onto the country page landing experience gave me the opportunity to evolve and deepen those value propositions.

<mark>I stepped into a Product Marketing role, translating internal brand theory into practical, customer-facing propositional statements and copy.</mark>

I love writing product marketing copy and believe it to be an important part of design. A beautiful visual design can be completely let down by unclear or unimaginative copy.

I wrote the three top-level propositional pillars, forming the structure of the proposition communication that I would flesh out in the prototype...

> "Your trip, their local expertise"

> "Tailor-made, made easy"

> "A fairer way to travel"

## The initial proposition-led prototype

## Rapid, customer-validated iteration of the prototype

## The designs for the A/B experiment

After a few rounds of iterating and validating via qualitative customer interviews, here's are the designs that we tested quantitatively via the A/B test.

## Building and launching the A/B experiment

### Quant test strategy

## Outcomes

We saw a <mark>200%+ increase in the engagement of customers</mark>, which was huge and proves that solid product design processes can lead to changes that have a substantial impact on key business metrics.
