Oh hey. These are a monthly-ish, _what's floating around in my head_ kind of things. I really enjoy getting a brief digest from Dave Rupert via his ["Vibe Checks"](https://daverupert.com/tag/vibecheck/) and the various year in reviews you get around this time ([Dan Mall](https://danmall.com/posts/2024-year-in-review/), [Tony Lijić](https://www.toni.li/blog/2024_in_review])). It's nice to follow along with other people's trials and tribulations from afar and I often pick up good article, book, TV etc recommendations. There's the flicker of an Actual Real Person™, something we should hang on to as tightly as our feeble organic meat claws will let us.

I still have this baby see, who's 10 months old now, and this past month it's felt a little bit more like hanging on in there. Just sleep and crying nothing major but the sense of overwhelm can be strong and January just SUCKS anyway.

The need for long-term patience seems to be a much more present part of every day than in _the before times_. It's been interesting to notice more acutely how comparitvely instant our gratification has become. If I'm asked to be patient, that means to wait like a week or two. To be really patient is to book a holiday 6 months away. The idea of being patient for something that could be an _undefined amount of years_ away, say a time when I can meaningfully introduce him to a film I love or when he can put himself to bed, is patience on a timescale we're really not used to.

Work wise I'm still leading product design at [TravelLocal](https://www.travellocal.com/en) but on a consultancy basis these days. With Miro's sunsetting of [Around](https://www.around.co/) (which my team liked for its casualness), we've been trialing what is my favourite new thing of the month, [Gather](https://www.gather.town/).

Think a cross between Stardew Valley and Pokémon Red (or Blue or Yellow if that's your thing), but instead of a farm it's your office, instead of Misty and Brock it's your colleagues and instead of training Digletts or growing corn, you, get this... do your day job.

I'll write more about Gather soon because I actually think it's a really smart and joyful solution to some of the challenges of remote working and the loss of physicality and office culture that can bring, but for now check out my new desk. I've got my own vending machine.

In January I joined a gym! What a cliche. My health hasn't been so great the last couple of years. Too much sitting at a laptop, arthritis and yeh if anyone knows where my super-duper 20's metabolism went I'd love to get that back. It's refreshing to have a space to go where I have literally no other reason for being there other than getting fitter. Aiming for twice a week. So far, not bad.

Last week we forgot to put the recycling out so this week's been a tough one for space in the kitchen. Tomorrow's the big day though so things are looking up.

I'm following the news but maintaining a healthy distance. Trying to be more aware of where I place my limited energy feels like the order of the day right now.

I did really enjoy [this article from The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/16/i-knew-one-day-id-have-to-watch-powerful-men-burn-the-world-down-i-just-didnt-expect-them-to-be-such-losers) though.

## In non-hanging news
Music, TV, books, articles, links, stand-up comedy etc
