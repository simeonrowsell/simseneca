Even the harsh realities of a Monday morning can provide product lessons if you look for them.

I generally like the old adage of "go slow to go fast", particularly when going deep into customer experiences and product strategy. Taking your time to really understand the challenges grants you clarity and confidence to make better decisions faster and more mindfully when it comes to implementation. It takes patience to gain that solid, smart foundation but when you have it everything you do from there just feels better.

Don't worry though, if you forget this then life will swiftly remind you that rushing is often a net-negative in the long run.

This morning I was rushing to get through the Monday get-up routine and make our daily stand-up on time. I spilled two drinks because I wasn't paying attention; one delayed me getting in the shower, the other leaving the door. 

Then I didn't put my gloves on before getting on my bike. To ✨_save time_✨ I thought I'd be real smart and do it at a red light. But one glove fell out of my pocket leading me to cycle back looking for it, fail, and then have to pedal quicker to make up the time.

I was 10 minutes late for stand-up, with a cold left hand and a new task to go and buy some more gloves.

Go slow to go fast or Monday morning will punish you.
