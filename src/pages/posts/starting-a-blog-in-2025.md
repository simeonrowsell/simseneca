One the one hand, I have this feeling that by starting a blog in 2025 I've kind of missed the boat. It seems a bit 'early internet' - people have been doing it for years and years. Do we need any more content? Is the web short of opinion pieces? Obviously no.

But it depends why you're writing.

I've been inspired over the years by web folk who seem to blog less in the hope of virality or 'hits' and more as a personal outlet for their thoughts, hopes and creativity (Dave Rupert, Chris Coyier, Brad Frost to name a few). I get the sense they'd be blogging even if nobody was reading. It feels more like journaling.

Someone once told me that before you get your first tatoo you should wait a year and if you're still thinking about it, you know it's something worth acting on. That was over a year ago and I still haven't got the tatoo. BUT the thought of blogging has sat in the back of my head for years and I'm trying to listen to those things more and act on them with less judgement and more creativity.

So in that sense, I guess now is as good a time as ever.

## The creative act of writing

## Help formulate thoughts

## Holding myself to account

## Track the passage of time

## Just to say
Getting this written down in case anyone points them out in the future and I can be all like "yep got it".
- My thoughts will probably change over time. I reserve that right. In fact, that's a wonderful thing.
- Some will be borderline pretentious. Authenticity is very important to me and I hope that will come through strongly, but also, sometimes, I want to try and impress you. Forgive me.
- Not all the posts will be that interesting to you. Hopefully they will be, but this is also for me so if I like 'em then we're good.
- I'll probably be wrong on some things. That's ok. Let me know and I'll learn.
- I currently have a 9 month old. I have limited time to write so in the spirit of ship, iterate, move forward there's a certain level of polish that'll be 'good enough'.
