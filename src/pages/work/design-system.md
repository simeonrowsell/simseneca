  To help meet their ambitious goals TravelLocal needed to ensure a seamless and consistent user experience across their customer journey, whilst allowing the team to prototype and build new experiences efficiently.

  As the Product Design Lead this meant establishing a modular design system from scratch and owning that across multiple years as the company, product and team scaled.

## Creating the design system and establishing atomic design principles
<!-- <img src="design-system-bla.jpg" class="wide" /> -->

Little brings me more satisfaction than atomic design. It just makes sense to the technical side of my brain to modularise, standardise and reuse design elements in the same way we have been doing with code for years. All hail [Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) ðŸ™Œ

<mark>I created the companyâ€™s design system and structured it around atomic design methodology.</mark>

Initially I mapped out everything that was already in production, defined anything that was missing and standardised it all into reusable elements. Beginning with subatomic elements I defined tokens such as colours and spacing and worked my way up through atoms, molecules, organisms and finally templates.

Figmaâ€™s component system is extremely powerful and its ability to nest components in components allowed me to build out complex design elements whilst retaining granular and centralised control.

Creating mid-high fidelity prototypes became extremely quick, meaning we could get them in front of users early in the discovery process to learn and iterate efficiently. The system allowed production-ready designs to be reliably of high quality and helped to standardise the communication between design intent and engineering implementation.
